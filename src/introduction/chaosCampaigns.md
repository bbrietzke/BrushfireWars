# What is a Chaos Campaign?
A Chaos Campaign is an abstract system which allows players to design a _force_ for a faction of choice for a particular era.
The players will then battle across different scenerios with a part of the force called a _task force_.

Each battles follow a _track_, which is a scenerio or a set of linked scenerios.
During each track, players will attempt to obtain _objectives_.  Objectives help determine the winner of the scenerio or scenerios.

In between tracks, each player will have a chance to repair, rearm and upgrade their force.

Each track earns _Warchest Points_ (WP) based on the objectives scored and victory conditions.
WP can be used to repair, rearm or aquire new personel, Mechs, vehicles or infantry during the campaign.
