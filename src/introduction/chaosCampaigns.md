### What is a Chaos Campaign?
A Chaos Campaign is an abstract system which allows players to design a _force_ for a faction of choice for a particular era.
The players will then battle across different scenerios with a part of the force called a _task force_.

Each battles follow a _track_, which is a scenerio or a set of linked scenerios.
During each track, players will attempt to obtain _objectives_.  Objectives help determine the winner of the scenerio or scenerios.

In between tracks, each player will have a chance to repair, rearm and upgrade their force.

Each track earns _Warchest Points_ (WP) based on the objectives scored and victory conditions.
WP can be used to repair, rearm or aquire new personel, Mechs, vehicles or infantry during the campaign.

### About the Campaign
This campaign is about telling stories of the many brush-fire wars in the Periphery.  
With it's collection of small, independent settlements, the pirates and competing interests that dominate the Periphery there are plenty of stories to tell.

All are seeking to be prosperous as they eek out an existence in this often harsh and unforgiving part of the galaxy.  
These are your stories, your adventures and your victories to tell.  

This campaign is designed to provide a framework to tell your stories, a digital campfire if you will on which we can gather around and share.  

Make this your own.
