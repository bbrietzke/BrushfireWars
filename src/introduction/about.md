# About this Campaign

This campaingn is about telling stories of the many brush-fire wars in the Periphery.
With it's collection of small, independent settlements, the pirates and competing interests that dominate the Periphery there are plenty of stories to tell.

All are seeking to be prosperous as they eek out an existence in this often harsh and unforgiving part of the galaxy.
These are your stories, your adventures and your victories to tell.

This campaign is designed to provide a framework to tell your stories, a digital campfire if you will on which we can gather around and share.

Make this your own.
