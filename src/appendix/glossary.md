### Crippling Damage
- Unless otherwise stated in the Special Rules section, crippling damage is defined as follows:
    - A ’Mech is considered crippled when a side torso location is destroyed; the ’Mech takes two engine critical hits; one gyro and one engine critical hit; or loses the use of its sensors. Internal structure
    damage in three or more limbs and/or two or more torsos, or four or more pilot hits, also renders a ’Mech crippled, as do the loss of all the ’Mech’s weapons to damage or ammunition depletion. If
    all of a ’Mech’s weapons are destroyed and it can no longer move, the ’Mech is considered destroyed. The pilot of a destroyed ’Mech may eject normally.
    - With the exception of infantry, all of a unit’s weapons are considered destroyed if it loses all weapons with a range greater than five hexes or if it can no longer cause more than 5 points of combined weapons damage.
    - A ProtoMech is considered crippled if all its weapons are lost to damage or ammunition depletion, or if the pilot suffers four or more hits. A ProtoMech Point will not begin to withdraw until
    three or more of its component ProtoMechs are either crippled or destroyed, at which point the entire Point must withdraw.
    - A vehicle is considered crippled if it loses all its armor in a single location or if all its weapons are destroyed.
    - An aerospace unit is considered crippled if it suff ers a critical hit to  its engine or fuel tank; if all its weapons are destroyed; if the unit loses more than half its original Structural Integrity; or if its pilot/
    crew suffers four or more hits.
    - An infantry platoon is considered crippled if it loses 21 or more troops (16 or more for jump platoons). If deploying infantry squads, a squad is considered crippled if it loses 5 or more troops.
    - A battle armor unit (Point or squad) is considered crippled if it loses half or more of its members.
    - Vehicles and BattleMechs that are immobilized—usually through motive, leg or gyro damage—are shut down and typically abandoned (though abandonment places the crew at the mercy of the battlefi eld). Only the most fanatical crews or those in dire circumstances will continue to fight. Likewise, only orders from the highest possible source will prompt an immobilized element not to withdraw from combat.

## D

### Destroyed
- A unit may be considered “destroyed” during a game, as described in the A Game of Armored Combat (AGOAC) rulebook
(see p. 35, AGOAC). However, there are instances when a unit “destroyed” in terms of a particular game is not truly destroyed in terms of the Campaign. In other words, it may be possible for a unit considered destroyed during gameplay to be returned to operational status by spending SP on repairs between tracks.
## F

### Forced Withdrawal
- Unless otherwise noted, units operating under Forced Withdrawal will follow the rules on page 258 in Total Warfare.


## S

### Salvage
- Salvage is the taking of destroyed/crippled equipment remaining on
the battlefield at the end of a track. In linked scenarios, salvage may not
occur until the end of the mini-campaign.
- In general, and unless a track’s special rules state otherwise, players
who achieve at least a Partial Victory in a track may claim all battlefi eld
salvage in any area where their units participated. Players may not claim
salvage after battles in which they did not participate.
- Salvage may be sold at half the unit’s normal list price. Alternatively,
vehicles, ’Mechs and other salvaged units may be repaired using the
Warchest system, or by converting Support Points to C-bills and using the
appropriate rule set to buy such repairs by spending the C-bill cost of all repaired or replaced equipment.
- Players interested in more detailed Salvage rules can fi nd them beginning on page 191 of Strategic Operations.

## T

### Truly Destroyed
- A ’Mech is only truly destroyed when its center torso internal structure is eliminated: this cannot be repaired. All other damage sufficient to consider a unit “destroyed” during gameplay can be repaired between tracks, including a completely destroyed head location (however, in that case, a new MechWarrior will need to be hired).
